	<h3>1.0.1.RELEASE - Release Notes</h3>
	
	<p>
		This is a minor bug fix of Gemini Management. Two extra methods have been added to the ServiceStateMBean to 
		allow the lookup of Services based on BundleId. Naming has also been improved throughout the project with 
		all instances of 'mgmt' being replaced with 'management'. You may need to update your p2 references if 
		you use the update site.
